# advanced-regression-techniques

Here's a project on Data Preperation using Python and feature engineering using 6 Assumptions of Multiple Linear Regression
<br>Assumption 1 - Minimal Multicollinearity
<br>Assumption 2 - Linearity
<br>Assumption 3 - Mean of Residuals is Zero
<br>Assumption 4 - Normality
<br>Assumption 5 - Regression

# Getting Started
1. Install the latest version of python via homebrew
2. Install Jupyter Notebook
3. Upload the Cleaned Data Set (cleaned_training.csv) 

If you want to learn my process on cleaning the data set check data-exploration-cleaning repo on my github.
